Programming Projects 2: Summative Assessment (D.6, D.7, D.8)

Assess to what extent students are able to
Identify, implement, and use the following data structures as appropriate for a given problem: lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash, heaps.
Judge which data model (list, stack, queue, tree, hash, heap) is appropriate for solving a problem.
Justify the choice of a data structure to solve a problem based on issues such as time and space.
Judge which search algorithm and data structure is appropriate for solving a problem.
Judge which tree traversal algorithm and data structure are appropriate for solving a problem.
